# Queue Debug and Status Features

## Overview
Implemented three key features to improve visibility and user experience of the per-student quiz queue system.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Debug Queue Display (Student Page)
**Location**: `public/student.html`

**Visual Component**:
- Fixed position debug panel in bottom-right corner
- Dark semi-transparent background
- Shows all quizzes in student's current queue
- Updates in real-time as queue changes

**Display Information**:
- Queue length (empty state vs. items)
- Quiz titles for each item in queue
- Push ID (truncated) for debugging
- Current quiz indicator (▶️) vs pending (⏸️)
- Position number for each quiz

**CSS Classes Added**:
- `.debug-queue` - Main container styling
- `.debug-queue-item` - Individual queue item styling
- `.debug-queue-empty` - Empty state message

**JavaScript Functions**:
- `updateDebugQueue()` - Refreshes debug display with current myQueue array
- Called automatically on:
  - `quiz_queue_updated` event
  - `show_next_quiz` event
  - `queue_empty` event

**Example Display**:
```
🐛 Queue Debug
▶️ 1. Introduction to ESP32
   Push ID: a1b2c3d4...
⏸️ 2. GPIO Basics
   Push ID: e5f6g7h8...
⏸️ 3. WiFi Setup
   Push ID: i9j0k1l2...
```

### 2. Answer Submission Form Disable
**Location**: `public/student.html` - `answer_submitted` event handler

**Behavior**:
1. When student clicks "Submit Answer"
   - Button disabled immediately with text "Submitting..."
   
2. After server confirms submission
   - Show success message: "Answer submitted successfully!"
   - Disable all form inputs:
     - Text answer textarea (`disabled = true`)
     - All multiple choice radio buttons (`disabled = true`)
     - All option items (`pointer-events: none`, `opacity: 0.6`)
   - Change button text to "Submitted"
   
3. Auto-hide after 2.5 seconds
   - Quiz overlay disappears automatically
   - Server sends next quiz (if available) or queue_empty event
   - Prevents accidental re-submission

**Code Changes**:
```javascript
socket.on('answer_submitted', (data) => {
    showQuizMessage('Answer submitted successfully!', 'success');
    disableQuizSubmission();
    
    // Disable all form inputs
    document.getElementById('textAnswer').disabled = true;
    document.querySelectorAll('.option-item').forEach(item => {
        item.style.pointerEvents = 'none';
        item.style.opacity = '0.6';
    });
    document.querySelectorAll('input[type="radio"]').forEach(radio => {
        radio.disabled = true;
    });
    
    // Auto-hide after 2.5 seconds
    setTimeout(() => {
        hideQuiz();
    }, 2500);
});
```

**User Experience**:
- Clear visual feedback that answer was accepted
- Prevents confusion about whether answer was saved
- Smooth transition to next quiz
- No flickering or premature hiding

### 3. Student Queue Status in Teacher Dashboard
**Location**: `public/teacher.html` and `server.js`

#### Server-Side Changes (`server.js`)

**Modified Function**: `updateOnlineList()`

**New Data Sent to Teachers**:
Each online student now includes:
```javascript
{
    user_id: 123,
    username: "student1",
    display_name: "Bob Smith",
    connected_at: "2025-10-20T10:30:00Z",
    queue_length: 3,              // NEW
    current_quiz: {               // NEW
        push_id: "abc123",
        quiz_id: 456,
        title: "Introduction to ESP32"
    },
    pending_count: 2              // NEW (queue_length - 1)
}
```

**Algorithm**:
1. For each online student, retrieve their queue from `studentQueues` Map
2. First item in queue = currently viewing quiz
3. Remaining items = pending quizzes
4. Emit updated data to all connected teachers

**Called After**:
- Quiz pushed to students (`/api/pushes` endpoint)
- Student answers quiz (`quiz_answer` socket handler)
- Student connects/disconnects

#### Client-Side Changes (`public/teacher.html`)

**CSS Classes Added**:
```css
.student-item .queue-info         /* Base styling */
.student-item .queue-info.viewing /* Blue - currently viewing */
.student-item .queue-info.pending /* Yellow - waiting in queue */
```

**Modified Function**: `updateOnlineStudentsList()`

**Display Logic**:
```javascript
if (student.queue_length > 0) {
    if (student.current_quiz) {
        // Show currently viewing quiz
        queueInfo = `📝 Viewing: ${student.current_quiz.title}`;
    }
    if (student.pending_count > 0) {
        // Show pending count
        queueInfo += `⏳ ${student.pending_count} pending`;
    }
} else {
    // No quizzes in queue
    queueInfo = '✅ No pending quizzes';
}
```

**Example Display**:
```

## Technical Architecture

### Data Flow

#### Push Quiz Flow:
```
Teacher pushes quiz
    ↓
Server adds to each student's queue (checks duplicates)
    ↓
Server emits quiz_queue_updated + show_next_quiz to students
    ↓
Server calls updateOnlineList()
    ↓
Teachers receive updated student status with queue info
```

#### Answer Quiz Flow:
```
Student submits answer
    ↓
Server saves response, removes from queue
    ↓
Server emits answer_submitted to student
    ↓
Student disables form, shows success, auto-hides after 2.5s
    ↓
Server emits show_next_quiz or queue_empty
    ↓
Student's debug panel updates
    ↓
Server calls updateOnlineList()
    ↓
Teachers see updated queue status
```

   - Identify students with long pending queues

2. **Pacing Decisions**:
   - If most students show "Viewing: X", wait before pushing new quiz
